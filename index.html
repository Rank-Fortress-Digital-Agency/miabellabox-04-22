                    Nurses have been the backbone of the medical field for decades, but even more so over the last two years as the pandemic ravaged through the world. Never ending workdays, sleepless nights, tired bodies, exhausted minds, shattered emotions. Many went above and beyond, pushing themselves beyond limits, travelling to locations in most needs, taking on extra shifts, all in hopes of saving lives and brining hope. Yet despite all that, at times, this profession was met with a lot of criticism, unreasonable demands, and overwhelming expectations. In a couple of weeks, we will all have an opportunity to thank nurses for their sacrifices and contributions.

                    <a href="https://nursingcecentral.com/nurses-week-2022-what-freebies-discounts-and-deals-to-expect/">National Nurses Week</a> falls between May 6-12 since 1993 when the <a href="https://www.nursingworld.org/">ANA</a> Board of Directors designated these dates permanently. Furthermore, on May 12, the birthday of Florence Nightingale, the International Council of Nurses (ICN) leads the way celebrating <a href="https://www.icn.ch/news/investing-nursing-and-respecting-nurses-rights-key-themes-international-nurses-day-2022">International Nurses Day</a>. This year’s theme is “A Voice to Lead – Invest in Nursing and Respect Rights to Secure Global Health”.  While our appreciation for the nurses should not be limited to just one week in a year, these celebrations are a great opportunity to appreciate and recognize nurse professionals for their work and contributions to the society.
